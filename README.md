# otest 0.1.3 - Unit Testing for Scala and ScalaJs 

Its suites are very similar to FunSuites from ScalaTest and its assertions simply throw `cgta.otest.AssertionFailure` when they fail.

It was inspired by [utest](https://github.com/lihaoyi/utest), but designed to fit into our legacy codebase, with minimal refactoring.

It currently is built targeting `Scala 2.10` & `Scala 2.11` as well as  `ScalaJs 0.5.0-RC2`

## Motivation

CGTA  has several hundred unit tests written as FunSuites for ScalaTest,
we are in the process of porting our codebase over to cross compile in ScalaJs
and we needed something that would make porting over the unit tests as easy as
possible.

There is nothing amibitious about otest, it simply tries to be what we at CGTA need
for our unit testing and nothing more.

##A Sample Test

Here is an example of a very simple test suite

TestBinaryHelp.scala:
```scala
import cgta.otest.FunSuite

object TestBinaryHelp extends FunSuite {
  test("popCnt32") {
    Assert.isEquals(0, BinaryHelp.popCnt32(0))
    Assert.isEquals(1, BinaryHelp.popCnt32(1))
    Assert.isEquals(1, BinaryHelp.popCnt32(2))
    Assert.isEquals(8, BinaryHelp.popCnt32(0xFF))
    Assert.isEquals(32, BinaryHelp.popCnt32(-1))
    Assert.isEquals(1, BinaryHelp.popCnt32(Int.MinValue))
    Assert.isEquals(31, BinaryHelp.popCnt32(Int.MaxValue))
  }
  test("ZigZag64") {
    Assert.isEquals(0L, BinaryHelp.decodeZigZag64(BinaryHelp.encodeZigZag64(0)))
    Assert.isEquals(-1L, BinaryHelp.decodeZigZag64(BinaryHelp.encodeZigZag64(-1)))
    Assert.isEquals(1L, BinaryHelp.decodeZigZag64(BinaryHelp.encodeZigZag64(1)))
    Assert.isEquals(Long.MaxValue, BinaryHelp.decodeZigZag64(BinaryHelp.encodeZigZag64(Long.MaxValue)))
    Assert.isEquals(Long.MinValue, BinaryHelp.decodeZigZag64(BinaryHelp.encodeZigZag64(Long.MinValue)))
  }  
  ...
}

```

Here is a summary of the avaible assertions:
```scala
isTrue(actual: Boolean, clues: Any*)
isEquals[A, B](expected: A, actual: B, clues: Any*)(implicit ev: CanAssertEq[A, B])
isNotEquals[A, B](expected: A, actual: B, clues: Any*)(implicit ev: CanAssertEq[A, B])
isAnyEquals(expected: Any, actual: Any, clues: Any*)
isNotAnyEquals(expected: Any, actual: Any, clues: Any*)
isIdentityEquals(expected: AnyRef, actual: AnyRef, clues: Any*)
isNotIdentityEquals(expected: AnyRef, actual: AnyRef, clues: Any*)
isLt[A](a: A, b: A, clues: Any*)(implicit ordering: Ordering[A])
isLte[A](a: A, b: A, clues: Any*)(implicit ordering: Ordering[A])
isGt[A](a: A, b: A, clues: Any*)(implicit ordering: Ordering[A])
isGte[A](a: A, b: A, clues: Any*)(implicit ordering: Ordering[A])
fail(msg: String = null)
intercepts[T](body: Unit) 
intercepts[T](clues: Any*)(body: Unit) 
```
*Note that the intercepts[T] are implemented with macros*

A full list of available assertions can be seen [here](/otest/src/main/scala/cgta/otest/Asserts.scala).

You can see them in action in their [unit test](/examples/example-tests/src/test/scala/cgta/osampletests/TestAssertions.scala)


#### Assert failures are just exceptions

An assertion works by throwing an exception of type `AssertionFailure` the test suite will catch that exception, terminate the current test and display a message describing the failure, a stack trace, and any clues provided.

#### Type-safety and `isEquals` vs `isAnyEquals`: 

Typically when comparing two things in an assert block those two things should be of the same type. By default otest enforces this with the `isEquals` / `isNotEquals` asserts. If you want to use standard java-style equality just use `isAnyEquals`. The typesafe way is most often the right way so it's the default. One special case kept popping up when porting our tests over, combinations of `Some[_]`, `Option[_]` and `None`. With the magic of implicits isEquals is able to recognize that `isEquals(Some(4), Option(4))` is a reasonable enough assertion while `isEquals(Some(4), Some("4"))` isn't. When comparing different types of sequences, we coerce them to a common type of sequence, typically just calling `.toList`. 

##Using with SBT

otest runs in sbt, it doesnt' have support for maven or any other build systems as we only use sbt in-house.

It is is released in two versions, a -jvm version for projects targeting the Jvm and an -sjs version for ScalaJs projects targeting javascript.

#### Add the sbt plugin for otest:

Sbt has to register it's test runner with sbt. to do that you will have to add an sbt plugin to your project. The plugin is hosted on bintray which is an alternative to maven central. You will have to add a plugin for bintray as well.

So in project/plugins.sbt add the following:

   resolvers += Resolver.url(
      "bintray-sbt-plugin-releases",
      url("http://dl.bintray.com/content/sbt/sbt-plugin-releases"))(
        Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)
    
    addSbtPlugin("me.lessis" % "bintray-sbt" % "0.1.1")

    addSbtPlugin("biz.cgta" % "otest-sbt-plugin" % "0.1.3")

where `0.1.3` is the version you want to use (this readme might fall out of date, check the tags in github to be sure)

*NOTE: Be sure to keep this version in sync with the versions below!*

If you are compiling for scala js you will also need to include the ScalaJs Plugin
in your plugins.sbt file, making it look something like this:

    resolvers += Resolver.url(
      "bintray-sbt-plugin-releases",
      url("http://dl.bintray.com/content/sbt/sbt-plugin-releases"))(
        Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)
    
    addSbtPlugin("me.lessis" % "bintray-sbt" % "0.1.1")

    addSbtPlugin("org.scala-lang.modules.scalajs" % "scalajs-sbt-plugin" % "0.5.0-RC2")
    
    addSbtPlugin("biz.cgta" % "otest-sbt-plugin" % "0.1.3")

#### In a ScalaJvm project:

add the following to the build.sbt:

    seq(bintrayResolverSettings:_*)

    cgta.otest.OtestPlugin.settingsJvm
    
    libraryDependencies += "biz.cgta" %% "otest-jvm" % "0.1.3" % "test"

#### In a ScalaJs project:

add the following to the build.sbt:

    seq(bintrayResolverSettings:_*)

    cgta.otest.OtestPlugin.settingsSjs
    
    libraryDependencies += "biz.cgta" %%% "otest-jvm" % "0.1.3" % "test"

*NOTE: The triple '%%%' in the version string here, this is added to sbt by the scalaJs plugin. Whereas %% handles binary incompitabilites between versions of Scalac, %%% goes one step further and ensures compatibility between ScalaJs versions by adding a tag like `_sjs0.5.0-RC1` to the artifact id as well.*

*ALSO NOTE: Just as above for you the plugin you will need to include the settings for ScalaJs, making your build.sbt file look something like this:*

    scala.scalajs.sbtplugin.ScalaJSPlugin.scalaJSSettings
    
    seq(bintrayResolverSettings:_*)
    
    cgta.otest.OtestPlugin.settingsSjs
    
    libraryDependencies += "biz.cgta" %%% "otest-sjs" % "0.1.3" % "test"

### Building otest
clone the repo locally, cd into it, and run the shell script

`bin/test`

It will publishLocal SNAPSHOT versions of otest for jvm and sjs, and it will run
the example tests on each of them.


### Additional Notes

#### Licensing
MIT see the [LICENSE file](/LICENSE).

#### Cross building

If you want to cross-build your source like we do for jvm+sjs projects compatibility
look at the [CGTA sbt-x-sjs-plugin project](https://github.com/cgta/sbt-x-sjs-plugin) as well as the [example
project](/examples) and this project's [build](/project) If you decide to go down this route I'd suggest giving [Better Living Through sbt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-_h_m4GjVo) a watch on youtube, to see how to setup a [firmwide plugin project](https://github.com/Banno/banno-sbt-plugin) for sbt.

#### Thanks

The ScalaJs team [Sï¿½bastien Doeraene](https://github.com/sjrd) & [Tobias Schlatter](https://github.com/gzm0) for making it possible to write code in worst language out there (except every other one, of course) while deploying to the web and reaching the largest audience of users in history.


Thanks to Li Haoyi, for making [utest](https://github.com/lihaoyi/utest) as well as [several](https://github.com/lihaoyi/upickle), [other](https://github.com/lihaoyi/scala.rx), [excellent](https://github.com/lihaoyi/scalatags) ScalaJs compatible libraries
